# gmtk-2021-game
SFU Game Dev Club's team game for gmtk 2021 https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021 using godot https://godotengine.org/features

Game Title: TBD

# git rules:
1. Clone the repo. Making a fork would be too much work.
2. Never push directly to main, unless you're just editing a readme or something very small. If you found you accidentally made lots of changes on *your local copy* of master, before commiting simply make a new branch and the changes will get moved there.
3. Make a unique branch for each 'feature' you implement, and push all your changes to those branches. 'Features' can be any size you want, as long as they don't overlap too much with others.
4. When you want to combine your changes with the main version, you make a pull request to master and can confirm it right away. (Remember to delete a branch after pushing!)
