# gmtk-2021-game
SFU Game Dev Club's team game for gmtk 2021 https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021 using godot https://godotengine.org/features

Game Title: TBD

# git rules:
1. Clone the repo. Making a fork would be too much work.
2. Never push directly to master, unless you're just editing a readme or something very small. If you found you accidentally made lots of changes on your local copy of master, simply make a new branch and the changes will get moved there.
3. Push changes to a unique branch for your own development.
4. When you want to combine your changes with the main version, you make a pull request to master and can confirm it right away.
